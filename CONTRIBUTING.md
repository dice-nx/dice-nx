Contributing code to DICE-nx
============================

Thank you for choosing to contribute to the DICE-nx Git repository :-)

As a small project, our contributing guidelines are pretty small and there
aren't a lot of rules. Nevertheless, the project does require these rules to be
followed.

* All contributions must be licensed under the [BSD 3-clause license](LICENSE).
  If your contribution is not under this license, but it is under a compatible
  license, please include evidence of this.
* You must be the original author of the contribution; if you are not, you must
  be able to prove that you are entitled to contribute the code (this is easy if
  you are incorporating existing BSD-licensed open source code).
* Commit messages must follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
  scheme.
* Write updates to [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) following the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
  scheme.
