        USING AlphaSpell

        AlphaSpell is a command line spelling checker. It compares an
alphabetized list of words with a dictionary. The dictionary must be an
alphabetized list of words with a single word on each line. To get a brief
rundown on how to use AlphaSpell, you should type "AlphaSpell" at the CLI
prompt. It will display the following:

[33mAlphaSpell[31m V1.01 - A Command Line Spelling Checker.
Copyright © 1992 Fergus Duniho, All Rights Reserved.

Usage: AlphaSpell <Command> <Dictionary> <Words>
<Command> = IN, OUT, or ALL. Only the first letter is necessary.
<Dictionary> and <Words> are both alphabetized lists of words.
IN prints each word from <Words> that is also in <Dictionary>.
OUT prints each word from <Words> that isn't in <Dictionary>.
ALL prints a single alphabetized list of all words in both.
IN and OUT also print the location where each word is or would be.

        Although AlphaSpell is a command line spelling checker, it's
primarily meant to be used with ARexx macros for text editors and word
processors. When it's RUN from an ARexx macro, its output should be
redirected to a file with ">". Its default mode, OUT, is meant to be used
for generating a list of words that might be misspelled. The IN mode should
be used with a dictionary of words that you are looking out for, such as a
list of homonyms and over-used words. I intend to write such a dictionary
in the near future, along with an ARexx macro for using it with DME. The
ALL mode is used for adding a list of words to the dictionary.

        ADDING WORDS TO YOUR DICTIONARY

        To add a list of words to your dictionary, you should type
something like this at the CLI prompt:

        > AlphaSpell >T:D ALL <Dictionary> <Words>

        This command will combine the contents of <Dictionary> and <Words>
into a new file called T:D. To replace the old dictionary with T:D, you
should then type

        > Move T:D <Dictionary>

        If you don't have "Move", which comes with ARP, you should type the
following lines instead:

        > Copy T:D <Dictionary>
        > Delete T:D

        Instead of redirecting the output of AlphaSpell to T:, you can also
choose to redirect it to a new file in the same directory as your
dictionary. You might type something like this:

        > AlphaSpell >New ALL <Dictionary> <Words>
        > Delete <Dictionary>
        > Rename New Dictionary

        It doesn't matter whether <Words> contains the same word more than
once, and it doesn't matter whether it contains words in <Dictionary>.
The combined list will not include any repetitions as long as both lists
are alphabetized.

        Changes since SpellCheck V1.00:

           A.   The command is now the first argument instead of the last.

           B.   The command can be upper or lower case.

           C.   "ALL" now skips over repetitions in <Words>.

           D.   The default behavior is now to print the usage.
