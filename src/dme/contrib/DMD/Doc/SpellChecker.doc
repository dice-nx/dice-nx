                      DMD Spell Checker Version 1.01
                      Copyright © 1992 Fergus Duniho

        The DMD Spell Checker consists of three ARexx macros
(ListWords.dme, Spellchecker.dme, and LookUp.dme), the AlphaSpell program,
and a dictionary. The dictionary is public domain, but the macros and
program belong to me, Fergus Duniho. I took the dictionary from Jonathan
Potter's SuperSpell, deleted some words from it, and added others to it
while testing the "Add" feature of this Spell Checker.

        DISTRIBUTION

        The macros are subject to the same distribution requirements as the
rest of DMD, and I have already outlined those in DMD.ReadMe. Since the
dictionary is public domain, however, it is not subject to the same
requirements. You may freely add to or subtract from it before you
redistribute it. If you do change the dictionary, however, please add no
misspelled or duplicate words to it, and please keep all the words in ASCII
order. AlphaSpell may be distributed separately from DMD. See
AlphaSpell.doc for further details.

        DISCLAIMER

        I am not responsible for any mishap or catastrophe that may result
from the use of this product. You use it at your own peril. Should you
encounter any bugs, however, please tell me about them, so that I can
correct them.

        Moreover, I do not guarantee the fitness of this product for any
purpose. In fact, I make no guarantees whatsoever.

        USING THE SPELL CHECKER

        To spell check the document in the current window, first make sure
that the disk with the dictionary is in one your disk drives. Then select
"Check Spelling" from the "Misc." menu. DME will first call a macro called
ListWords. This macro will create a capitalized list of all the words in
your document. It counts as a word any string of letters, both English and
foreign, whose length is greater than one. It also recognizes apostrophes
as parts of words. So, it will recognize "DON'T" and "I'LL" as words. But
it won't recognize an apostrophe-S as part of a word, and it won't
recognize apostrophes that appear at the beginning or the end of a word.
So, when such words as "'TIS" and "IT'S" appear in your document, it will
recognize them as "TIS" and "IT". After ListWords creates a list of the
words in your document, it will sort that list into alphabetical order.

        DME then calls the Spellchecker macro. If you have not already
selected a dictionary, it will pop up a file requester for you to choose
which dictionary it will use. After it knows which dictionary to use, it
will compare the alphabetized list of words in your document to the
dictionary. Whenever it finds that a word from the list is not in the
dictionary, it adds that word to another list. Once the Spell Checker has
determined which words are not in the dictionary, it either tells you that
there were no misspelled words, or it pops up a requester for going through
the list of words that were not in the dictionary. It goes through this
list in alphabetical order. It goes to the first line in the document where
the word appears, highlights that line for your convenience, and displays
the word in the requester.

        The requester has a string gadget and twelve button gadgets. The
button gadgets are "Skip," "Back," "Find," "Add," "Unadd," "Add All,"
"Done," "Guess," "Forward," "Backward," "Replace," and "Replace All."

        "Skip" moves you to the next word in the list of words not in the
dictionary. If you were at the last word, it moves you to the first word.

        "Back" moves you to the previous word in the list of words not in
the dictionary. If you were at the first word, it moves you to the last
word.

        "Find" finds the next occurrence of the word and highlights the line
it is on.

        "Add" tells the Spell Checker to add the current word to the
dictionary's '.new' file when you press "Done." It then works the
same as "Skip." Whenever you go back to a word you chose to add, the
requester will indicate this.

        "Unadd" tells the Spell Checker that you have decided against
adding a word that you had previously decided to add. It then works
the same as "Skip." If you go back to the word, the requester will indicate
that you have chosen not to add it.

        "Add All" tells the Spell Checker to add every word in its list to
the appropriate '.new' file. It does so immediately and exits. This gadget
is useful when you are adding to the dictionary a list of words you already
know to be correctly spelled. If, for instance, you want to combine two
dictionaries, you can spell check one against the other, and then use this
gadget to dump all the words that were in it but not in the other into the
other.

        "Done" adds to the dictionary's '.new' file all the words for which
you clicked on the "Add" gadget. It then closes the requester and exits
from the Spell Checker.

        "Guess" displays the word that appears in the dictionary where the
current word would be if it were in the dictionary. It displays this word
underneath the current word.

        "Forward" displays the next word in the dictionary.

        "Backward" displays the previous word in the dictionary.

        "Replace" tells the Spell Checker that you want to replace the
current occurence of the word. It will replace it with whatever you have
entered into the string gadget.

        "Replace All" tells the Spell Checker to replace the current
occurence of the word and every occurence after it with whatever you have
entered into the string gadget. It then moves you to the next word in the
list.

        The CLOSEWINDOW button exits from the Spell Checker WITHOUT adding
any words to the dictionary's '.new' file.

        ADDING NEW WORDS TO THE DICTIONARY

        The Spell Checker creates and appends to the '.new' file of
whatever dictionary it is using. This file has the same name as the
dictionary with a '.new' extension at the end. It contains words that are
to be added to the dictionary. When you want to add these words to the
dictionary, open a CLI window and type

        > AlphaSpell >T:D ALL Dictionary Dictionary.new
        > Move T:D Dictionary

        or type

        > AlphaSpell >Dictionary.n ALL Dictionary Dictionary.new
        > Delete Dictionary
        > Rename Dictionary.n Dictionary

        Wherever "Dictionary" appears in the above lines, you should
substitute the name of your dictionary with its full path.

        You can use a similar procedure for adding the contents of another
dictionary to your dictionary, and for adding your own lists of words to
your dictionary. Merely substitute "Dictionary.new" with the name of the
file you want to add. Before you add the contents of a file to your
dictionary, you should make sure that its words are spelled correctly, that
no words appear in it twice, and that all the words in it are alphabetized.

        An effective way to do this is to spell check the document you want
to add. ListWords.dme will eliminate redundancies and alphabetize your
list. Then, if you already know that the words in your file are correctly
spelled, you can click on "Add All" to dump them all into the '.new' file.

        You do not have to worry about whether any file you add contains
words that are already in your dictionary. AlphaSpell will not add to the
dictionary any words that are not already in it. This makes it rather easy
to add two dictionaries together.

        And, of course, you can directly edit the dictionary with DME.

        USING OTHER DICTIONARIES

        You do not have to use the dictionary that comes with the Spell
Checker. You may use any dictionary that contains a single word on each
line, and which has all its words sorted in ASCII order. You may wish to
delete from any other dictionary you use any words that ListWords will not
recognize, such as hyphenated words and words that end with apostrophe-S.
To select your dictionary, use "Select Dictionary" from the "Misc." menu.
It pops up a requester for you to select a dictionary to use with the Spell
Checker.

        LOOKING UP A WORD

        To look up a word, select "Look Up Word" from the "Misc." menu. A
requester will appear for you to type in the word you want to look up. If
the word is in the dictionary, it will tell you that no words were
misspelled. Otherwise, it will present the AlphaSpell requester, which I
have already described in this documentation.

        FUTURE PROJECTS

        I intend on writing a style checker for DME. This will point out
such things as homonyms, commonly confused words, hackneyed words, weak
words, and other misused words. AlphaSpell can already be used as a
style checker. But I still have to write the dictionary it will use, as
well as the ARexx interface for DME.

        Over the summer, I hope to write the registered version of
AlphaSpell, along with a modified requester. The registered version will
skip through a compacted dictionary, which I already have. It will also
include a program for compacting and decompacting dictionaries. As soon as
I figure out how to write C code for the string operations I need, I will
be able to write these programs. I currently have them coded in ARexx,
which is slower. When I'm not at my summer job, I'll study C more closely
and learn what I need to know.

        CHANGES

        V1.01:

        I have replaced The "Keep" gadget with the "Find" gadget. Since it
often took a long time to find the first occurrence of each word, "Skip"
and "Back" no longer do this. Each merely goes to the beginning of the
document. This allows you to go through the words much more quickly. If you
want to see where the word occurs in the document, click on the "Find"
gadget. It is prudent to always use the "Find" gadget before you use the
"Replace" gadget. That way, you can make sure you are replacing what you
want to replace. But this piece of advice does not apply to "Replace All,"
for it should generally be used for replacing an obviously misspelled word
thoughout your document.
