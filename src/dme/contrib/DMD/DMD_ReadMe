       I.   Introduction:

            This is a set of macros that greatly enhance the use of Matt
            Dillon's text editor DME (© 1988-91 Matt Dillon). It includes
            an extensive .edrc file, which includes 10 menus and many many
            macros. It also includes 20 ARexx macros, which do such things
            as renumber an outline, access the file requester for various
            operations, single space and double space text, center text,
            and more. And it includes a spelling checker and dictionary.

            I released previous versions of this macro set under the title
            "Fergus Duniho's DME 1.42 Macro Set." I have shortened the
            title to DMD, which stands for Duniho's Macros for DME.
            Consequently, I've started the numbering over.

      II.   Disclaimer:

            I am not responsible for any mishap or catastrophe that may
            result from the use of this product. You use it at your own
            peril. Should you encounter any bugs, however, please tell me
            about them, so that I can correct them.

     III.   Philosophy:

            I have written these macros for two purposes: power and
            user-friendliness. The more important of these is power. That
            means you will have to read the documentation and study the
            macros to get all the power they can give you. Nevertheless,
            these macros will still give you a great deal of power even if
            you use them without reading the documentation or studying the
            macros. Many of the most important commands are accessible from
            the menus, and the menus indicate the keystrokes for those
            macros that are also accessible from the keyboard. Since I
            could not fit every macro onto the menus, however, you cannot
            get the full benefits of these macros unless you read what they
            can do.

      IV.   Contents--This Macro Set should contain the following files:

            DMD/REXX/Spellchecker.dme
            DMD/REXX/WC.dme
            DMD/S/.EDRC

       V.   Installation:

            To install these macros, double click on Install_DMD. This
            will copy DMD/S/.EDRC to S:, DMD/C/AlphaSpell to C:, and the
            files in DMD/REXX/ to REXX:.

            To use the ARexx macros, you should put the following lines in
            your startup-sequence:

            Rexxmast
            rxlib rexxsupport.library 0 -30 0
            rxlib rexxarplib.library 0 -30 0
            rxlib req.library -5 -60 2

            If you want to use the functions from rexxmathlib.library with
            the calculator called by a-Enter, you should also add the
            following line to your startup-sequence:

            rxlib rexxmathlib.library 0 -30 0

            Of course, these lines won't do you much good unless you have
            the appropriate libraries in LIBS:. If they aren't there, copy
            them there. And please note that you need arp.library in LIBS:
            for rexxarplib.library to do you any good. If you don't have
            arp.library, req.library, rexxarplib.library, or
            rexxmathlib.library, you can download them off almost any good
            bulletin board or anonymous ftp site for Amigas.

            If you have Ares, which comes with ARP, you should add the
            following line to your startup-sequence:

            Ares C:move C:sort

            This will speed up the macros that use these commands.

       V.   Distribution information:

           A.   You may freely distribute this macro set by modem or disk
                as long as you meet the following conditions:

               1.   You distribute it in its entirity, which means that
                    everything I listed in the contents must be distributed
                    together.

               2.   You add nothing to it.

               3.   You delete nothing from it.

               4.   You change nothing in it (except the dictionary).

               5.   You do not claim it as your own product or creation.

               6.   You do not include it with any commercial product
                    without my written permission.

               7.   You do not include it on any disk of freely
                    distributable software that costs more than what Fred
                    Fish charges for disks of freely distributable
                    software.

               8.   You do not upload it to any BBS that claims ownership
                    of everything on it.

               9.   You do not sell it for profit.

              10.   You retain the filenotes and file attributes if you
                    rearchive it.

           B.   You may distribute an archive of this macro set with your
                own freely distributable software if it enhances the use of
                that software. IOW, Matt Dillon is free to distribute an
                archive of this with any future release of DME.
